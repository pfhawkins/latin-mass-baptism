Welcome!

A Catholic wedding Mass has two parts:

1. the [Rite of Marriage](https://www.latinmasswedding.com/rite-of-marriage/)
2. the [wedding Mass](https://www.latinmasswedding.com/the-wedding-mass/).

In my experience, the vast majority of Catholic wedding resources online presuppose that the couple will have a _Novus Ordo_ Mass (the current form of the Catholic Mass) - to say nothing of the fact that most wedding resources focus on the reception.

This website provides information for those who would like a Latin Mass wedding, providing both the essential stuff, and the how & why of Latin Mass weddings.

The site mirrors a Latin Mass wedding as closely as possible: the Rite of Marriage has its own page, the wedding Mass has its own page, and everything else is under Resources.
