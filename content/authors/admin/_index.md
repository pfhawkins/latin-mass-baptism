Welcome!

A Catholic wedding Mass has two parts: 

1) the Rite of Marriage, and   
2) the wedding Mass.

The current form of the Catholic Mass (the _Novus Ordo_) has the _Rite of Marriage_ taking place in the middle of Mass, directly after the homily. The older form of the Catholic Mass (the _Latin Mass_) is substantially different from the _Novus Ordo_, and places the Rite of Marriage before the Mass begins.
