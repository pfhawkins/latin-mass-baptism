Welcome!

A Catholic wedding Mass has two parts: 

1) the Rite of Marriage, and   
2) the wedding Mass.

The current form of the Catholic Mass (the Novus Ordo) has the Rite of Marriage taking place in the middle of Mass, directly after the homily. The older form of the Catholic Mass (the Latin Mass) is not only substantially different from the Novus Ordo - it places the Rite of Marriage before the Mass even begins.

Learning about the Latin Mass can be difficult as it is; learning about Latin Mass weddings can be downright overwhelming.

This website provides information for those who would like a Latin Mass wedding, or are interested in learning about beautiful treasures of the Church regarding marriage.
