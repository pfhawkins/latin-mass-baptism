Welcome!

A Catholic wedding Mass has two parts:

1. the [Rite of Marriage](https://www.latinmasswedding.com/rite-of-marriage/)
2. the [wedding Mass](https://www.latinmasswedding.com/the-wedding-mass/).

In my experience, the vast majority of Catholic wedding resources online presuppose that the couple will have a _Novus Ordo_ Mass (the current form of the Catholic Mass) - to say nothing of the fact that most wedding resources in general focus on the reception. 

There are numerous and significant differences between a _Novus Ordo_ wedding Mass, and a _Latin Mass_ wedding. _Novus Ordo_ wedding Masses have a high degree of liturgical customization and has the _Rite of Marriage_ taking place in the middle of Mass, directly after the homily. The _Latin Mass_ set, and places the Rite of Marriage before the Mass begins.

This website provides information for those who would like a Latin Mass wedding, or are interested in learning about beautiful nuptial treasures of the Church. 

The site mirrors a Latin Mass wedding as closely as possible: the Rite of Marriage has its own page, the wedding Mass has its own page, and everything else (music, programs, FAQs) is under Resources.
