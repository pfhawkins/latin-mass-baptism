Welcome!

A Catholic wedding Mass has two parts:

1. the [Rite of Marriage](https://www.latinmasswedding.com/rite-of-marriage/)
2. the [wedding Mass](https://www.latinmasswedding.com/the-wedding-mass/).

In my experience, the vast majority of Catholic wedding resources online presuppose that the couple will have a _Novus Ordo_ Mass (the current form of the Catholic Mass) - to say nothing of the fact that most wedding resources focus on the reception. 

There are numerous and significant differences between _Novus Ordo_ and _Latin Mass_ weddings, such as a high degree of liturgical customization in the former.. 

This website provides information for those who would like a Latin Mass wedding, or are interested in learning about the beautiful liturgical and nuptial treasures of the Church. 

The site mirrors a Latin Mass wedding as closely as possible: the Rite of Marriage has its own page, the wedding Mass has its own page, and everything else is under Resources.
