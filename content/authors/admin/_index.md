Welcome!

A Catholic wedding Mass has two parts: 

1) the Rite of Marriage, and   
2) the wedding Mass.

The current form of the Catholic Mass (the _Novus Ordo_) has the Rite of Marriage taking place in the middle of Mass, directly after the homily. The older form of the Catholic Mass (the Latin Mass) is not only substantially different from the _Novus Ordo_ - it places the Rite of Marriage before the Mass even begins.
