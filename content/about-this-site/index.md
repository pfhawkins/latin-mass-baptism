_Artwork: Le Prince, Jean-Baptiste. "The Russian Baptism."  (1765)._

This is a sister site to my first project, [Latin Mass Wedding](https://www.latinmasswedding.com/). It's intended to provide those interested with the essential texts of the Rite of Baptism, as well as common blessings, customs, and rubrics. Whenever possible, I include both the Latin and the English text. 

Most pages have an “About” section at the top, to provide context.

Words in _italics_ can be found in the [Glossary](https://www.latinmassbaptism.com/glossary/).

I also have a [personal site](https://sharonkabel.com) of my research and writing.
