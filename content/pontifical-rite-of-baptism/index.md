# About

The Pontifical Rite of Baptism for Children is considered one of the most infrequently celebrated rites in the _Rituale Romanum_. Some books on pontifical ceremonies - themselves scarce - do not even include a section on baptisms. The _Rituale_ does not include the full text of the pontifical rite; merely several paragraphs of rubrics for the event.

The pontifical rite has many similarities to its original counterpart, but full text versions of the pontifical rite, to say nothing of summaries and commentaries, remain difficult to find. 

To ameliorate this gap, I created this page to provide both the full Latin-English text of the pontifical rite, as well as some supporting documentation. While I can lay claim to the formatting, these documents are primarily the work of some friends with similar passion for this topic, and who graciously have allowed me to recreate and reshare their work.

For the full text of the pontifical rite, I drew from two sources: Reverend Kennedy's _The New Sanctuary Manual_[^1], and Fr. Weller's _Roman Ritual_[^2]. Rubrics highlighted in grey in the first PDF below are from Weller's commentary. 

New Liturgical Movement has covered several pontifical baptisms, with photographs and commentary.[^3] [^4] [^5]
