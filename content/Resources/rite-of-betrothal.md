# About

Betrothal, or betrothment, is more solemn than an engagement, although the two may be seen as synonymous. Betrothal is, "a mutual promise of future marriage, or a contract by which a man and a woman engage themselves to marry." \[1\]

> Betrothment serves as a barrier against ill-omened haste; it renders the position of the engaged parties more secure; and it affords a better opportunity for bringing to light any impediments or incompatibility of disposition that may exist. It was in use among the Jews, the Romans, the Germans, and the Christians of the primitive Church. On the other hand in many modern codes, as in the Code Napoleon, and many others, betrothment is not recognised, and is without any binding force, though, in certain cases, it may afford ground for an action for damages. \[1\]

Similar to the Rite of Marriage, the specifics of the Rite of Betrothal have not always been legislated consistently, uniformly, and universally. Again similar to the Rite of Marriage, the Rite of Betrothal is an ancient and beautiful practice.
