## "Prayer of One about to be Married" 

O gracious Father, who dost bless us by Thy bounty, pardon us by Thy mercy, support and guide us by Thy grace, and govern us by Thy providence: I give Thee humble and hearty thanks for all the mercies which I have received at Thy hands in time past. And now, since Thou hast called me to the holy estate of marriage, be pleased to be with me in my entering into it and passing through it, that it may not be a state of temptation or sorrow to me by occasion of my sins or infirmities, but of holiness and comfort, of love and dutifulness, as Thou hast intended it to be to all that love and fear Thy holy name. Amen.

## A Husband’s Prayer

O gracious Father, Maker and Preserver of heaven and earth, who in the beginning didst institute matrimony, thereby foreshadowing the mystical union of the Church with our Saviour Christ, who, in the time of His ministry upon earth, did honor marriage with His first miracle: enable me, I pray Thee, by Thy grace to live in holiness and purity with the wife whom Thou hast given me. Mortify in me all violence of earthly passion, all selfishness and inconsiderateness (here name any besetting sin which may be a hindrance to you), that I may love her as Christ loved His Church, cherish and comfort her as my own body, and have as great care for her happiness as for my own. Grant that we may live in peace, without contention; in unity, without discord. (Give us, O Lord, discreet hearts and understanding minds, to bring up our children in Thy faith and fear, that they may be obedient to Thee and to Thy commandments, and to all 
that Thou requirest of them in duty towards their parents.) And give us, O Lord, a competency of estate, to maintain ourselves and our family according to that rank and calling wherein Thou hast placed us, without excess or vainglory, in singleness and pureness of heart. Grant this for Jesus Christ’s sakfe, to whom, with Thee and the Holy Ghost, be all honor and glory, now and for ever. Amen.

## A Wife’s Prayer

O merciful Lord God, who in the beginning didst take Eve out of the side of Adam and didst give her to him as a helpmate: give me grace to live worthy of the honorable estate of matrimony to which Thou hast called me, that I may love my husband with a pure and chaste love, acknowledging him as my head, and truly reverencing and obeying him in all good things; that thereby I may please him, and live with him in all Christian quietness. Keep me from all worldliness and vanity. Help me, O Lord, that I may, under him, prudently and discreetly guide and govern his household. Let no fault of mine aggravate any sins by which he may be especially tempted; enable me to soothe him in perplexity, to cheer him in difficulty, to refresh him in weariness, and, as far as may be, to advise him in doubt. (Give me understanding so to fulfil my part in the education of our children, that they may be our joy in this world and our glory in the next.) Grant that our perfect union here may be the beginning of the still more perfect and blissful union hereafter in Thy kingdom; and this I pray through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

## A Prayer to be said by Husband or Wife

O merciful God, we humbly beseech Thee to 
send Thy blessing continually upon us, and to 
make us thankful for all that Thou hast already 
vouchsafed unto us ; and as Thou hast made us one in 
the mystical grace of matrimony, grant that we may 
be also inwardly of one heart and of one mind, paying 
due honor one to another, united in love to Thee and 
to each other in Thee ; living together in peace and 
holiness, as faithful members of Thy Church, denying 
ourselves, and being a mutual help, comfort, and sup- 
port to each other, all the days of our life. [Give us 
grace to train our children in Thy faith and fear.] 
Bless us with health and strength, if it be Thy will, 
and with whatever else Thy good providence shall see 
to be best for our souls and bodies. Fit and prepare 
us day by day for our departure hence, that we may 
together inherit eternal life in Thy heavenly kingdom. 
Through the merits of Jesus Christ, our Lord and 
Saviour. Amen.
