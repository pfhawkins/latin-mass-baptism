# About

The nuptial blessing takes place shortly after the Our Father. It is an ancient blessing, with a rich history. A video of our nuptial blessing can be [found here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=f8CJjs2s6qg).

The blessing is for both the bride and the groom, but primarily for the bride. It is also only given in a first marriage.
