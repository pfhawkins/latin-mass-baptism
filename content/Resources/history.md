Both the Rite of Marriage and the Wedding Mass have complex histories, which are well worth exploring:

**4th century**: In his _Vulgate_, St. Jerome translates the Greek _mysterion_ into the Latin _sacramentum_, thus affirming Marriage as one of the seven Sacraments of the Catholic Church \[^1\] \[^2\]. Paulinus, bishop of Nola, provides us with the earliest documented instance of a Catholic wedding Mass in the West. Notably, there is no exchange of rings or vows (which scholars suggest likely took place earlier, in the home), and no celebration of the Eucharist. \[^3\]

**High Middle Ages**: The Middle Ages produces the greatest flowering of artistic and musical beauty within the Mass, leading to (among other things) enormous local and regional differences in celebrations of the Mass, and Masses overflowing, perhaps overburdened, with artistic zeal. Throughout this time, marriages are mostly private affairs, generally not requiring witnesses - consent of the two parties was valued above all else. Weddings usually did not take place in a Mass, or even in a church. This could reflect the Church's love of the local, despite her desire for universality.

**16th century**: The Protestant Revolution challenges Jerome's translation (preferring _mysterium_ to _sacramentum_), and the notion that marriage is a sacrament. Instead, marriage is redefined as a contract, important to the common good, and therefore important to the common good. Protestant weddings now must take place within a church, and are primarily didactic experiences. Later in this century, the Catholic Church calls the Council of Trent to clarify dogma, doctrine, and practices. The Church prunes the excesses of past centuries. Thanks to widespread problems with secret marriages, and to growing confusion with Protestant teaching, Catholic marriages now are required to be witnessed by a priest.

**1570**: Trent promulgates several key documents - the Catechism, the Breviary, the Missal, and St. Thomas Aquinas' Summa. These documents dramatically simplify practices and Masses, winnowing down elaborate ceremonies to their essentials, with the intention that local customs would be overlaid them. A wedding mass is included in the Missal, with readings taken from a wedding mass in a 12th century Roman Pontifical (a liturgical book for bishops). \[^4\]

**1614**: Trent creates the _Rituale_, the book of rituals and sacraments (separate from the _Missale_, which is about the Mass). This _Rituale_ features a Rite of Marriage - quite sparse, again, intending for the skeletal ritual to be adorned with local customs. Perhaps because of a desire to obey Rome, or fear about Protestant individualism, or unclear teaching from the Vatican, what happens instead is that the Rite of Marriage is adopted whole and entire, in place of local customs. \[^5\]

**1969-70**: A new Missal, with a new form of the Catholic Mass, is promulgated universally by the Second Vatican Council. A new rite of marriage is also promulgated.

> “The Greek word _mysterion_ was translated into Latin by two terms: _mysterium_ and _sacramentum_. In later usage the term _sacramentum_ emphasizes the visible sign of the hidden reality of salvation which was indicated by the term _mysterium_. In this sense, Christ himself is the mystery of salvation: “For there is no other mystery of God, except Christ.”

> The ritual elements of the rite, alluded to in passing (199-230), seem to be a mixture of classical Roman marriage rites (the joining of hands, the nuptial veil) and specifically Christian forms (hymn-singing, prayers of blessing and consecration). Notably absent is any mention of exchange of rings or vows (which would have taken place earlier in the home) or of the celebration of the Eucharist.

> In December 1563, the Council of Trent, already in process for nearly twenty years, decided that it could not itself undertake the task of reforming the liturgical books of the Western churches in communion with Rome, so it handed the task over to the pope. Five years later, the revised Roman Breviary appeared and, in 1570, the Missal. However, the Missal only contained the texts used in the celebration of the Mass. For the revised marriage rite, Catholics had to wait until the new Ritual was published in 1614.

> Thus the contracting of marriage was separated from its solemnization: the order for the former being found in the Ritual, while the Mass and nuptial blessing were contained in the Missal. The two dimensions of the rite were frequently separated in practice, since marriages contracted in the "closed seasons" and marriages in which one partner was not a Catholic of where the woman was marrying for the second time could not be "solemnized" and were celebrated without Mass or without the blessing. Nonetheless, the Council of Trent did more for marriage than order a revision of the rites. A major preoccupation of the Council was with the social mischief created by clandestine marriages, i.e. marriages entered into simply through the couple's exchange of consent, without public ceremony. Such was the concern of the Council that it took the unprecedented step of declaring such marriages simply void and invalid, despite the long history of the axiom that "consent makes marriage." One of the consequences of this was that Catholic marriages, to be considered valid, had to be celebrated now in the presence of a priest and in accordance with ecclesiastical law. Consequently, while we can never be quite sure whether ordinary people were wedded ceremoniously with the rites we have seen so far, it is certain that from that the sixteenth century, all marriages took place in church, with or without the nuptial Mass. The text of the Wedding Mass is characteristic of the Tridentine Missal in that it is not at all innovative. It approximates to many local missals of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, but is relatively simple and sober. The Gregorian Mass formularies stand alone, no longer accompanied by the various non-Roman texts that had continued to cluster around them throughout the Middle Ages, though the old Spanish prayer, "May the God of Abraham," is retained for a final blessing of the couple at the end of Mass. Fortunately, instead of the Mass of the Trinity which was so common in the Middle Ages, the Roman Missal opted to reclaim the proper texts for the Mass for Bride and Groom from the twelfth century Roman Pontifical.
