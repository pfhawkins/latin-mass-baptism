# About

Both the Rite of Marriage and the Wedding Mass have complex histories, which are well worth exploring. I am including a collection of comparisons on the Roman Rites of Marriage, and a brief timeline on the subject. 

# Ritual Comparisons 



# Brief timeline

* **4th century**: In his _Vulgate_, St. Jerome translates the Greek _mysterion_ into the Latin _sacramentum_, thus affirming Marriage as one of the seven Sacraments of the Catholic Church [^1] [^2]. Paulinus, bishop of Nola, provides us with the earliest documented instance of a Catholic wedding Mass in the West. Notably, there is no exchange of rings or vows (which scholars suggest likely took place earlier, in the home), and no celebration of the Eucharist. [^3]

* **High Middle Ages**: The Middle Ages produces the greatest flowering of artistic and musical beauty within the Mass, leading to (among other things) enormous local and regional differences in celebrations of the Mass, and Masses overflowing, perhaps overburdened, with artistic zeal. Throughout this time, marriages are mostly private affairs, generally not requiring witnesses - consent of the two parties was valued above all else. Weddings usually did not take place in a Mass, or even in a church. This could reflect the Church's love of the local, despite her desire for universality.

* **16th century**: The Protestant Revolution challenges Jerome's translation (preferring _mysterium_ to _sacramentum_), and the notion that marriage is a sacrament. Instead, marriage is redefined as a contract, and therefore important to the common good. Protestant weddings now must take place within a church, and are primarily didactic experiences. Later in this century, the Catholic Church calls the Council of Trent to clarify dogma, doctrine, and practices. The Church prunes the excesses of past centuries. Thanks to widespread problems with secret marriages, and to growing confusion with Protestant teaching, Catholic marriages now are required to be witnessed by a priest.

* **1570**: Trent promulgates several key documents - the Catechism, the Breviary, the Missal, and St. Thomas Aquinas' Summa. These documents dramatically simplify practices and Masses, winnowing down elaborate ceremonies to their essentials, with the intention that local customs would be overlaid them. A wedding mass is included in the Missal, with readings taken from a wedding mass in a 12th century Roman Pontifical (a liturgical book for bishops). [^4]

* **1614-1615**: Trent creates the _Rituale_, the book of rituals and sacraments (separate from the _Missale_, which is about the Mass). This _Rituale_ features a Rite of Marriage - quite sparse, again, intending for the skeletal ritual to be adorned with local customs. Perhaps because of a desire to obey Rome, or fear about Protestant individualism, or unclear teaching from the Vatican, what happens instead is that the Rite of Marriage is adopted whole and entire, in place of local customs. [^5]

* **1963**: During the Second Vatican Countil, the Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy calls for a revision of the _Rite of Marriage_.

* **1964**: There is a second English edition of the 1962 _Rite of Marriage_, with no modification to the Latin, and several additions to the English. 

* **1969-1970**: A new Missal, with a new form of the Catholic Mass, is promulgated universally by the Second Vatican Council. A new rite of marriage is also promulgated (called the first typical edition), with an English translation following.

* **1991**: A second edition of the revised _Rite of Marriage_ is promulgated (called the second typical edition). An English translation is delayed because of an ongoing, new translation of the Roman Missal. 

* **2012-2013**: The International Committee for English in the Liturgy (ICEL), the group responsible for the authorized English translations of Catholic liturgy and rituals, creates several drafts of a new English translation of the second typical edition of the _Rite of Marriage_. 

* **2016**: The ICEL publishes a new English translation of the second typical edition of the _Rite of Marriage_.
