> Curiously enough, many of the plants which came to be associated with Our Lady during the Middle Ages and the early Renaissance had been known since before the dawn of Christianity and their attributes were associated with pagan deities. Thus plants formerly associated with and considered sacred to Juno, Venus and Diana of Greek mythology, Bertha and Freyia of Scandinavian traditions were bestowed upon the Madonna. If we ponder the studies of the great humanist scholars and accept the belief that the coming of Christ brought a new sense of values into the world, then it is easy to understand how Christianity flung its shadow over the entire vegetable kingdom. In their ardor to stamp out every vestige of heathen intelligence and thought, the early fathers soon interpreted the folklore and the apparent associations of heathen nature worship with the Christian tradition. In every corner of the Old World, the life and sufferings of Christ and the everyday happenings of Mary and Joseph and the saints dominated the thoughts and the beliefs of peasant and nobleman alike. The Age of Faith had made a deep imprint.

> The English writer Hepworth Dixon has caught the spirit of this simple faith in these lines: "Hearing that the best years of her youth and womanhood were spent, before she yet knew grief, on this sunny hill and side slope, her feet being for ever among the daisies, poppies and anemones, which grow everywhere about, we have made her the patroness of all our flowers. The Virgin is our rose of Sharon, our lily of the valley. The poetry no less than the piety of Europe has ascribed to her the whole bloom and coloring of the fields and hedges." However, after the turmoil and upheaval caused by the Reformation, many of the folk names of plants previously associated with the Holy Family were divested of their divine associations. The dawn of secularism, in a large measure, cast a heavy shadow on that feeling of devotion which had previously characterized the Christian world.

> Anemones were also sacred flowers, possibly the “lilies of the field” mentioned in the New Testament. Some legends say that the red petals of these wild anemones came from the blood dripping down on them from Christ’s cross, and that they sprang up miraculously in Pisa’s Campo Santo cemetery after a Crusader ship had brought some earth for the graves back from the Holy Land.

> In February we found it gay with the beautiful crimson anemone (A. coronaria), which we were quite willing to accept as the ‘Rose of Sharon,’ while a little yellowish-white iris, of more modest appearance, growing along with it, represented the ‘lily of the valley’ of Solomon’s song.

Ullrich. “Symbolism of Plants: Examples from European-Mediterranean Culture Presented with Biology and History of ArtSEPTEMBER: Cornflower.” _Journal of Experimental Botany_, vol. 60, no. 12, Aug. 2009, pp. 3297–99. _academic.oup.com_, doi:[10.1093/jxb/erp247](https://doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erp247).

> Cyanus (blue) was the name of the cornflower from Mediterranean antiquity up to the 18th century. The scientific name of the genus, Centaurea (given by Linnaeus) was derived from the story of the ‘centaur’ Chiron, Achilles’ adviser. According to Greek myth, Achilles was wounded with a poisoned arrow (by Herakles), and his wound was healed by applying cornflower plants. The poison came from Hydra, in Greek mythology usually imagined as a huge poisonous water snake, but at that time interpreted as a giant slug. In Christian symbolism, slugs were associated with the devil, hence the remedy, cornflower, became a symbol of the Queen of Heaven, Mary, and Christ, and was often depicted in paintings of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, frequently seen in Christian frescos. A fine example is found in St Michael's church in Bamberg (northern Bavaria). On the vaulted ceiling several hundred plant species have been depicted, among them cornflower (Fig. 2). \[...\] The cornflower has also been used as a symbol of tenderness, of fidelity, and of reliability (Beuchert, 2004). Botticelli (15th century) decorated the garments of some of the figures in his paintings with a cornflower design (e.g. in the ‘Birth of Venus’). Another example from Botticelli was discussed in the Plant Culture series by Battey (2003) as a decoration of ‘spring’ personified. By contrast, cornflower has also been used as a symbol of power and majesty such as in the tapestry called ‘Verdure of arms of Emperor Charles V’ (Fig. 3). The two-headed eagle as the sign of the Habsburg Monarchy and the coat of arms is surrounded by various realistically-drawn plants, among them cornflower, with its tubular florets and characteristic bracts dominating the space.

> Still, such tree souvenirs were dwarfed by the colossal number of flower bouquets, and cornflowers in particular, sent to Wilhelm I at each milestone in his life. Supplanting the oak tree as royal emblem, the cornflower was so ubiquitous...that it became known as “the Emperor’s flower” (_Kaiserblume_) and remained so well after his death.

> As suggested by the saying below, the daisy is probably associated with this celebration because, as mentioned previously, St Michael is celebrated as a protector from darkness and evil, just as the daisy fights against the advancing gloom of Autumn and Winter.

> “The Michaelmas Daisies, among dede weeds,  
> Bloom for St Michael’s valorous deeds.  
> And seems the last of flowers that stood,  
> Till the feast of St. Simon and St. Jude.”

> (The Feast of St. Simon and Jude is 28 October)

> The act of giving a Michaelmas Daisy symbolises saying farewell, perhaps in the same way as Michaelmas Day is seen to say farewell to the productive year and welcome in the new cycle.

> Bells of Ireland, or Molucella, has long been associated with Ireland, though, because they are considered a symbol of good luck and are mostly green. Even Linnaeus seemed confused about the origins of the plant when he named them Molucella, after the Moluccan Islands of Indonesia. \[...\] Perhaps the confusion is because Bells of Ireland have been widely cultivated all over Europe since the late 1500’s as an ornamental flower for fresh or dried floral arrangements. They were especially popularly grown in Belgium. Long before these plants were said to represent good luck in the Victorian language of flowers, they were used all over the world in wedding bouquets and arrangements to bless the couple with good fortune.

> Rue is considered a national herb of Lithuania and it is the most frequently referred herb in Lithuanian folk songs, as an attribute of young girls, associated with virginity and maidenhood. It was common in traditional Lithuanian weddings for only virgins to wear a rue (ruta) at their wedding, a symbol to show their purity.
