# About

In addition to having their own rubrics, flower have rich traditions in Catholicism, history, art, amd music! Below are relevant rubrics (also on the Rubrics page), and some notes from my own floral research. 

# Rubrics 

## Altar flowers 

Flowers on the altar should be either fresh and cut, or if they are artificial, of the highest quality. Potted/rooted plants should not be placed on the altar, as the cut plants symbolize a sacrificed life. [^1]

## Flowers around the church

Flowers around the church may be fresh and cut, artificial, or potted. The flowers should be beautiful and harmonious with the church and the vestments, when possible. [^2] 

## Flowers for the wedding party 

In all matters, but particularly for this point, consult the rules and expectations of the church where you intend to marry.

# My bouquet

![](/uploads/_MG_0325-min.JPG)

My bridal bouquet (description from my wedding program):

> The **cornflower** [^3] [^4] is one of Germany’s national symbols. They are associated with faithfulness and the Habsburg monarchy. The last ruling Habsburgs, Karl and Zita, are on their way to sainthood, and are two of the only (almost) saints to be venerated specifically for the vocation of marriage. **Rue** [^5] is the national herb of Lithuania, and commonly used by Lithuanian brides for hair wreaths. \[...\] During the Medieval Era, it became popular to dedicate a garden to Mary, and over time, numerous plants became associated with her. The flowers we have chosen stem from this tradition. **Roses** [^6] [^7] and **Sweet Williams** both have a Marian connection, and a connection to the bride’s and groom’s names (Rose of Sharon, and William). **Anemones** [^8] have an historical connection to both Mary and the Crusades. (Post-wedding note: I was unable to get sweet williams, so I added daises. [^9])
