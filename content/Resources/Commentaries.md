Tobias 7:15; 8:19
Deus Israel coniungat vos: et ipse sit vobiscum, qui misertus est duobus unicis: et nunc, Domine, fac eos plenius benedicere te. 

May the God of Israel join you together: and may He be with you, who was merciful to two only children: and now, O Lord, make them bless Thee more fully.

Ver. 15.  Hand.  This was the mode of confirming agreements, in Media.  Alex. Genial v. 3. --- The custom prevailed in marriages, (Lament. v. 6.  Isai. lxii. 8.) as it does still among Christians. --- It.  Gr. "her for a wife to Tobias, and said: Behold: take care of her according to the law of Moses, and go to thy father.  And he blessed them.  And he called Edna, his wife, and taking a book, wrote a note, (H. or contract.  C.) and sealed it, and they began to eat."  H. --- It was almost universally the custom to have such writings, particularly where polygamy prevailed.  The wives of lower condition were taken without formality.  C.
        
Ver. 19.  Make.  Gr. "Shew them mercy, Lord.  Perfect their life in health, with gladness and mercy.  But he ordered his domestics to fill up the grave, and he made them a marriage feast for fourteen days.  And," v. 23.  The ancient Vulg. seems rather more conformable to the present. "Raguel ordered his wife to make several loaves, and going himself to the flock, he brought two cows and four rams, and ordered them to prepare a feast.  He called Tobias, and swore to him, saying, Thou shalt not depart hence these 14 days, but remain here eating and drinking with me, and shalt fill with joy me and my daughter, who has been greatly afflicted.  Receive half of my goods, and thou shalt return safe and sound to thy father; and after my death, and that of my wife, thou shalt have the other half."  H. --- Gr. and Heb. mention nothing of the beasts slaughtered, or of Raguel's testament.  C.

Ephesians 5:22-33

Fratres: Mulíeres viris suis súbditæ sint, sicut Dómino: quóniam vir caput est mulíeris: sicut Christus caput est Ecclésiæ: Ipse, salvátor córporis ejus. Sed sicut Ecclésia subjécta est Christo, ita et mulíeres viris suis in ómnibus. Viri, dilígite uxóres vestras, sicut et Christus diléxit Ecclésiam, et seípsum trádidit pro ea, ut illam sanctificáret, mundans lavácro aquæ in verbo vitæ, ut exhibéret ipse sibi gloriósam Ecclésiam, non habéntem máculam, aut rugam, aut áliquid hujúsmodi, sed ut sit sancta et immaculáta. Ita et viri debent dilígere uxóres suas, ut corpora sua. Qui suam uxórem díligit, seípsum díligit. Nemo enim unquam carnem suam ódio hábuit: sed nutrit, et fovet eam, sicut et Christus Ecclésiam: quia membra sumus córporis ejus, de carne ejus, et de óssibus ejus. Propter hoc relínquet homo patrem et matrem suam, et adhærébit uxóri suæ: et erunt duo in carne una. Sacraméntum hoc magnum est, ego autem dico in Christo, et in Ecclésia. Verúmtamen et vos sínguli, unusquísque uxórem suam, sicut seípsum díligat: uxor autem tímeat virum suum. 
        
Wives, be subject to your husbands, as to the Lord.  For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, and is himself its Savior. As the church is subject to Christ, so let wives also be subject in everything to their husbands. Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her, that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word,  that he might present the church to himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be holy and without blemish.  Even so husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. For no man ever hates his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, as Christ does the church, because we are members of his body. “For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.” This mystery is a profound one, and I am saying that it refers to Christ and the church; however, let each one of you love his wife as himself, and let the wife see that she respects her husband..

Ver. 23. For the husband is the head of the wife. Though S. Paul here speaks of a man, who is a husband, we may rather translate man than husband, being the same sentence and same words as 1 Cor. xi. 3. where even the Prot. translation has, that the man is head of the woman. — He (Christ) is the saviour of his mystical body, the Church: though some expound it, that the husband is to save and take care of his wife, who is as it were his body. Wi.
        
Ver. 24. As the church is subject to Christ. The Church then, according to S. Paul, is ever obedient to Christ: and can never fall from him, but remain faithful to him, unspotted and unchanged to the end of the world. Ch.

Ver. 26. Cleansing it by the laver[3] of water, in the word of life. By this washing is generally understood the sacrament of baptism; and by the word of life, not the word of the gospel preached, but the words or form used in the administration of baptism, according to Christ’s institution: but this is not so certain. Wi.

Ver. 27. Not having spot or wrinkle. S. Aug. and others expound it of the glorious Church of Christ, in heaven: others even of the Church of Christ in this world, as to its doctrine, sacraments, and discipline, or practices approved by the Catholic Church. Wi.

Ver. 28-31. He that loveth his wife, loveth himself. S. Paul would have this a love like that which a man hath for himself, or for his own flesh, when they are now joined in wedlock, and are become as it were one flesh and one person, as to a civil life and society. See Mat. xix. 5. The wife is to be considered as a part of the husband, as a member of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones. The words are to be taken with an allusion to what Adam said, (Gen. ii. 23.) This is now bone of my bones, &c. And so, according to the apostle, speaking figuratively, the Church, which is the spouse of Christ, is framed as it were of his bones and of his flesh sacrificed on the cross. Wi.

Ver. 32. This … sacrament, (or mystery) … in Christ, and in the Church. This sacrament, in construction, must be referred to what immediately went before, i.e. to the conjunction of marriage betwixt man and wife; and this is called a great sacrament, or mystery, as representing the union or spiritual nuptials of Christ with his spouse, the Church.
