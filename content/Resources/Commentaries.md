Tobias 7:15; 8:19

Deus Israel coniungat vos: et ipse sit vobiscum, qui misertus est duobus unicis: et nunc, Domine, fac eos plenius benedicere te.

May the God of Israel join you together: and may He be with you, who was merciful to two only children: and now, O Lord, make them bless Thee more fully.

    <p><strong>Overall Impression:</strong> A pale, bitter, highly attenuated and well carbonated Trappist ale, showing a fruity-spicy Trappist yeast character, a spicy-floral hop profile, and a soft, supportive grainy-sweet malt palate.</p>
    <p><strong>History:</strong> While Trappist breweries have a tradition of brewing a lower-strength beer as a monkâ€™s daily ration, the bitter, pale beer this style describes is a relatively modern invention reflecting current tastes. Westvleteren first brewed theirs in 1999, but replaced older lower-gravity products.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p><strong>Overall Impression:</strong> A deep reddish-copper, moderately strong, malty, complex Trappist ale with rich malty flavors, dark or dried fruit esters, and light alcohol blended together in a malty presentation that still finishes fairly dry.</p>
    <p><strong>History:</strong> Originated at monasteries in the Middle Ages, and was revived in the mid-1800s after the Napoleonic era.</p>
