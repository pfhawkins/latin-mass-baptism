# About

Rubrics are the "how" of rites and Masses. There are rubrics on the Latin Mass in general [^1]; this page is for rubrics specific to the wedding Mass.

More information can be found at Corpus Christi Watershed [^2] [^3]. 

# General Rubrics

The wedding Mass is a second class votive Mass. On first class feasts, the readings for the first class feast are said (but the nuptial blessing and final blessing may still be used).

Omitted: Tract 
Used: Gradual + lesser Alleluia

> "**The Mass has neither Gloria nor Creed**. It counts as a votive Mass not for a grave matter; therefore it has three collects, its own, the commemoration of the day, and the third which is the one chosen for semi-doubles at that time of the year unless there be two commemorations. At the end Benedicamus Domino and the Gospel of St. John are said. **The colour is white**. The bridegroom and bride assist near the altar (just outside the sanctuary), the man on the right. After the Pater noster the celebrant genuflects and goes to epistle side. Meanwhile the bridegroom and bride come up and kneel before him. Turning to them he says the two prayers Propitiare Domine and Deus qui potestate (as in the Missal) with folded hands. He then goes back to the middle and continues the Mass. They go back to their places. He gives them Communion at the usual time. This implies that they are fasting and explains the misused name "wedding breakfast" afterwards. But the Communion is strict law (S.R.C., no 5582, 21 March, 1874). Immediately after the Benedicamus Domino and its answer the celebrant again goes to the Epistle side and the bridegroom and kneel before him as before. The celebrant turning to them says the prayer Deus Abraham (without Oremus). He is then told to warn them "with grave words to be faithful to one another". The rest of the advice suggested in the rubric of the Missal is now generally left out. He sprinkles them with holy water; they retire, he goes back to the middle of the altar, says Placeat tibi, gives the blessing and finishes Mass as usual." [^4]
