# About

Old prayer books contain many beautiful prayers for holy water, the newly baptized, for conversions, and for parents. 

Perhaps the best place to start is the _Collectio Rituum_, which has prayers for baptismal water, pregnant mothers, and many other related topics: 

Collectio Rituum Romanum. Edited by Laudate Dominum. 1925. http://laudatedominum.net/files/coll_rit_rom.pdf.

Below is a small sample of more freely available old Catholic prayer books.
