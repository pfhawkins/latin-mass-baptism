# Does the whole baptism have to be in Latin? 

No. In fact, much of the traditional rite of Baptism can be said in the vernacular. There are set prayers that can only be said in Latin, including the blessing of salt, the exorcisms, and the anointing must be in Latin. The _Collectio Rituum_, a condensed version of the _Rituale Romanum_, has the most clear layout to show which parts can be vernacular, and which must be Latin. A PDF of the _Collectio_ is available at Laudate Dominum[^1].
