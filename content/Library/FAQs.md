**I want a TLM wedding! What do I do?**

Great! The most important thing you’ll need is a priest familiar with the TLM wedding, or willing to learn it. Immediately get in touch with said priest, and the church in which you intend to marry. Availability of priests who can say the TLM (and receptivity to saying it at all) will vary by diocese. Get in touch with the church music director as well. Start a conversation about music for your mass, as you will not (or at least, should not) be following the [“4 hymn sandwich.”](https://www.catholiceducation.org/en/culture/music/propers-of-the-mass-vs-the-four-hymn-sandwich.html) [^1]

**What’s different with a Latin Mass wedding?**

The big things that are different are the language, and the order of events. The language is in Latin, the official language of the Catholic Church.

In most modern Christian ceremonies, the actual wedding - the Rite of Marriage - happens in the middle of the mass. In the Latin Mass, the Rite of Marriage happens at the beginning, and is followed by the mass, uninterrupted.

**What can I customize with the wedding Mass?**  
Not much, really. The _propers_ for the wedding Mass (texts of the Mass that change each Sunday, like the readings) are set, unlike a _Novus Ordo_ wedding. If you want a sung Mass, you can choose some of the music, to an extent, and how the music is sung (like _chant_ or _polyphony_). You may be able choose what kind of Latin Mass you’ll have, although this may depend entirely on the resources available to you and your church.

Low Mass = nothing is sung; 1 priest  
High Mass = sung; 1 priest  
Solemn High Mass = sung; 3 priests (priest, deacon, and subdeacon) \[^2\]

So, ask yourself:

1. what can I do, realistically? Then,
2. Do I want a mass without music or with music?
3. If I want a mass with music, do I want a high mass or a solemn high?

A solemn high would require 3 priests, familiar with or open to learning the TLM wedding.

**Be aware of the liturgical season when choosing your Mass.** Traditionally penitential times, or “closed times” (_tempus clausum_) like Advent, Lent, and the Vigil of Pentecost, discourage weddings, especially sung Masses. Again, this will vary, as resources and general catechesis varies by diocese. Dispensations can be requested for particular dates. However, one should make an effort not to schedule such a festive occasion like a wedding in a penitential time like Lent.

You can, of course, customize non-liturgical elements of the day, like flowers. Read more about floral traditions on the Flowers page.

You will not choose lectors, as the priest(s) will recite or chant the readings. You will likely not choose altar servers, as they will have to be familiar with the Latin Mass.

**What kind of music can or should I have?**

Check out the Music page for more information! Generally speaking, the best music setting for the mass is _Gregorian chant_, and the best texts are the _propers_ (because they are directly from Scripture). Strictly speaking, hymns are private meditations and belong to the Divine Office or other private prayer time. Hymns are usually allowed for the procession in, and procession out, but otherwise they should not be used in the Mass. What you can choose are the _settings_ for the mass texts; for example, you can have the ordinaries (Kyrie, Gloria, etc.) sung to Gregorian chant, or to a psalm tone, or to a polyphonic (multi-voice - soprano, alto, etc.) setting.

Realistically, though, this will depend on the resources available to you. Be in touch with your church’s music director to see what is feasible.

**You’re using words that I don’t recognize.**

I made a Glossary page here.

**How can I help my wedding guests understand what's happening?**

Check out the Other Resources menu, which includes links to introductory content on the both Latin Masses and Latin Mass weddings. I have also linked to several examples of Latin Mass wedding programs, including my own that has a page explaining the what and why of a Latin Mass wedding. You are free to reuse my wedding program content!

Biretta Books offers a Latin-English booklet for Latin Mass weddings: [https://www.birettabooks.com/for-the-faithful/latin-english-booklet-missal-for-nuptial-mass/](https://www.birettabooks.com/for-the-faithful/latin-english-booklet-missal-for-nuptial-mass/ "https://www.birettabooks.com/for-the-faithful/latin-english-booklet-missal-for-nuptial-mass/") [^3]. For those familiar with the red Latin Mass booklets - it is the exact same book, but with additional texts for the Rite of Marriage.
