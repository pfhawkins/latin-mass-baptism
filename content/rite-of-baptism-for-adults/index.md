1. The priest, vested in surplice and purple stole or even a cope of the same color, comes to the altar steps
with his assistants. He kneels and implores God's help, after which he rises, signs himself with the cross, and
says:
Priest: God, come to my rescue.
All: Lord, make haste to help me.
P: Glory be to the Father.
All: As it was in the beginning.[1]
2. Then he intones the antiphon which is continued by the assistants (if this and the following psalms are to be
sung see the music supplement):
Antiphon: I will pour out on you pure water, and you shall be cleansed of all your stains, says the Lord.
If possible he sings or recites the following alternately with all who are present:
All: Ant. I will pour out * on you pure water, and you shall be cleansed of all your stains, says the Lord.
P: O Lord, our Lord, how glorious is your majesty over all the earth! * you have exalted your majesty above
the heavens.
All: Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings you have fashioned praise because of your foes, * to silence the
hostile and the vengeful.
P: When I behold your heavens, the work of your fingers, * the moon and the stars which you set in place--
All: What is man that you should be mindful of him, * or the son of man that you should care for him?
P: You have made him little less than the angels, * and crowned him with glory and honor.
All: You have given him rule over the works of your hands, * putting all things under his feet:
P: All sheep and oxen, * yes, and the beasts of the field,
All: The birds of the air, the fishes of the sea, * and whatever swims the paths of the seas.
P: O Lord, our Lord, * how glorious is your name over all the earth!
All: Glory be to the Father.
P: As it was in the beginning.
Psalm 28
P: Give to the Lord, you sons of God, * give to the Lord glory and praise,
48
All: Give to the Lord the glory due His name; * adore the Lord in holy attire.
P: The voice of the Lord is over the waters, the God of glory thunders, * the Lord, over vast waters.
All: The voice of the Lord is mighty; * the voice of the Lord is majestic.
P: The voice of the Lord breaks the cedars, * the Lord breaks the cedars of Lebanon.
All: He makes Lebanon leap like a calf * and Sarion like a young wild bull.
P: The voice of the Lord strikes fiery flames; the voice of the Lord shakes the desert, * the Lord shakes the
wilderness of Cades.
All: The voice of the Lord twists the oaks and strips the forests, * and in His temple all say, "Glory!"
P: The Lord is enthroned above the flood; * the Lord is enthroned as king forever.
All: May the Lord give strength to His people; * may the Lord bless his people with peace.
P: Glory be to the Father.
All: As it was in the beginning.
Psalm 41
P: As the hind longs for the running waters, * so my soul longs for you, O God.
All: Athirst is my soul for God, the living God. * When shall I go and behold the face of God?
P: My tears are my food day and night, * as they say to me day after day, "Where is your God?"
All: Those times I recall, now that I pour out my soul within me, when I went with the throng * and led them
in procession to the house of God,
P: Amid loud cries of joy and thanksgiving, * with the multitude keeping festival.
All: Why are you so downcast, O my soul? * Why do you sigh within me?
P: Hope in God! For I shall again be thanking him, * my Savior and my God.
All: My soul is downcast within me; * so will I remember you from the land of the Jordan and of Hermon,
from Mount Misar.
P: Deep calls unto deep in the roar of your cataracts; * all your breakers and your billows pass over me.
All: By day the Lord bestows His grace, * and at night I have His song, a prayer to my living God.
P: I sing to God, "My Rock, why do you forget me? * Why must I go about in mourning, with the enemy
oppressing me?"
All: It crushes my bones that my foes mock me, * as they say to me day after day, "Where is your God?"
P: Why are you so downcast, O my soul? * Why do you sigh within me?
49
All: Hope in God! For I shall again be thanking Him, * my Savior and my God.
P: Glory be to the Father.
All: As it was in the beginning.
Repeat the antiphon:
I will pour out on you pure water, * and you shall be cleansed of all your stains, says the Lord.
3. Then he says:
Lord, have mercy. Christ, have mercy. Lord, have mercy. Our Father (the rest inaudibly until:)
P: And lead us not into temptation.
All: But deliver us from evil.
P: Lord, heed my prayer.
All: And let my cry be heard by you.
P: The Lord be with you.
All: May He also be with you.
Let us pray.
Almighty, everlasting God, who enable us, your servants, in our profession of the true faith, to acknowledge
the glory of the three Persons in the eternal Godhead, and to adore their oneness of nature, their co-equal
majesty; grant, we pray, that by steadfastness in that faith we may ever be guarded against all adversity.
Hear our prayer, almighty God, so that what we purpose to do by our lowly ministry may have its full effect
by your power.
We beg you, O Lord, grant that our chosen one (ones), well instructed in the holy mysteries, may be born
again in the font of baptism and be added to the household of your Church; through Christ our Lord.
All: Amen.
AT THE ENTRANCE OR IN THE VESTIBULE OF THE CHURCH
4. Next the priest calls the candidates by their full name, first the men then the women, and each one answers
"Present." Afterward he puts these questions to them:
P: What are you asking of God's church?
All: Faith.
P: What does faith hold out to you?
All: Everlasting life.
50
P: If, then, you wish to inherit everlasting life, keep the commandments, "Love the Lord your God with all
your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself." On these two
commandments depend the whole law and the prophets. Now faith demands that you worship one God in
Trinity, and Trinity in unity, neither confusing the Persons one with the other, nor making a distinction in
their nature. For the Father is a distinct Person, so also the Son, so also the Holy Spirit; yet all Three possess
the one nature, the one Godhead.
5. He questions them further, with all giving the answers together, each one for himself in the singular forms:
P: Do you renounce Satan?
All: I do renounce him.
P: And all his works?
All: I do renounce them.
P: And all his attractions?
All: I do renounce them.
6. Next the priest questions them on the Creed, saying:
P: Do you believe in God, the Father almighty, Creator of heaven and earth?
All: I do believe.
P: Do you believe in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord, who was born into this world and suffered for us?
All: I do believe.
P: Do you also believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness
of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting?
All: I do believe.
7. The priest thrice blows softly in their face, and follows up the gesture with the words below, saying them
only once:
7a. But if it seems impractical to breathe on them from a distance, he simply holds his right hand outstretched
toward the catechumens while he says the words:
Depart from them, unclean spirit, and give place to the Holy Spirit, the Advocate.
{The previous act of blowing (exsufflation) was a sign of removing something, or, figuratively, driving out
the evil spirit. The next act of breathing on them (insufflation, a breath as if preceded by the letter h) is a sign
of giving something, or, figuratively, bestowing on them God's Spirit and His blessing.}
8. Here he breathes softly on them in the form of a cross, saying:
Receive, by this breath, the good Spirit along with His blessing.
P: Peace be with you.
51
All: And also with you.
8a. Here again if it seems impractical to breathe on them from a distance, he holds his hand as in 7a while he
says:
Receive, by this laying on of hands, the good Spirit along with His blessing.
P: Peace be with you.
All: And also with you.
9. Then the candidates pass in single file before the priest, who makes the sign of the cross on the brow and
heart of each, saying:
N., receive the sign of the cross on your brow and on your heart. Put your whole trust in the heavenly
teachings. And lead a life that will truly fit you to be a dwelling place for God. On entering God's Church
acknowledge with joy that you have escaped the clutches of death.
{But if the number of catechumens is large, they remain in their place and sign themselves with the thumb on
the brow and heart, at the same time that the priest makes the twofold sign of the cross over them, saying:
Receive the sign of the cross on your brow and on your heart. Put your whole trust in the heavenly
teachings. And lead a life that will truly fit you to be a dwelling place for God. On entering God's Church
acknowledge with joy that you have escaped the clutches of death.}
The priest continues:
Worship God the Father almighty, and Jesus Christ, His only-begotten Son, our Lord, who is coming to judge
both the living and the dead and the world by fire.
All: Amen.
The priest then adds (using the singular forms when required):
Let us pray.
I entreat you, blessed Lord and Father, almighty and everlasting God, to point out the way of truth and godly
knowledge to these servants of yours who grope in uncertainty and doubt in the darkness of this world. Open
their inner sight, the better to see you as the one God, the Father in the Son and the Son in the Father, in union
with the Holy Spirit. May it be their good fortune to enjoy the fruit of this avowal both now and forevermore;
through Christ our Lord.
All: Amen.
9a. If there are serious objections to the priest himself tracing the sign of the cross on the person of the
catechumen, then, in accord with the general norms for this rite (no. 3a), the conference of bishops may
determine whether the subjects are to be signed with the cross by the godparents or do so themselves, while
the priest simply makes the sign of the cross over them.
10. After this the candidates pass again in single file before the priest, who traces the sign of the cross with his
thumb on the brow of each, saying:
I sign you on the brow that you may take up the cross of our Lord.
52
On the ears: I sign you on the ears that you may listen to the heavenly teachings.
On the eyes: I sign you on the eyes that you may see the grandeur of God.
On the nostrils: I sign you on the nostrils that you may sense the sweet fragrance of Christ.
On the mouth: I sign you on the mouth that you may proclaim the word of life.
On the breast: I sign you on the breast that you may believe in God.
On the shoulders: I sign you on the shoulders that you may take on you the yoke of His service.
{But if the number of catechumens is large, there is no objection to having a number of priests perform the
above ceremonies.}
Finally he makes one large sign of the cross over the elect, saying:
I sign all of you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, that you may come to
your eternal destiny and have life without end.
All: Amen.
Then he adds these two prayers (using the singular forms when required):
Let us pray.
Lord, if it please you, hear our prayer, and by your inexhaustible power protect your chosen ones, N. and N.,
now marked with the sign of our Savior's holy cross. Let them treasure this first sharing of your sovereign
glory, and by keeping your commandments deserve to attain the glory of heaven to which those born anew
are destined; through Christ our Lord.
All: Amen.
Let us pray.
God, who first made the human race and then fashioned it anew, show your mercy to the people you are to
adopt, and by the New Covenant add them as new offspring to your family. Thus, as children of the promise,
may they delight in having become by grace what they could not have aspired to by nature; through Christ our
Lord.
All: Amen.
10a. But if it is inadvisable for the priest to trace the sign of the cross on their person (see no. 9a above), then
the candidates, remaining in their place, sign themselves with the thumb on the respective parts of the body
each time the priest makes the sign of the cross, saying:
I sign you on the brow that you may take up the cross of our Lord.
On the ears: I sign you on the ears that you may listen to the heavenly teachings.
On the eyes: I sign you on the eyes that you may see the grandeur of God.
On the nostrils: I sign you on the nostrils that you may sense the sweet fragrance of Christ.
53
On the mouth: I sign you on the mouth that you may proclaim the word of life.
On the breast: I sign you on the breast that you may believe in God.
On the shoulders: I sign you on the shoulders that you may take on you the yoke of His service.
11. Then the priest holds his hand outstretched over them and says (using the singular forms when required):
Let us pray.
Almighty everlasting God, Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, look with favor on your servants whom it has[1]
pleased you to call to this first step in the faith. Rid them of all inward blindness. Sever all snares of Satan
which heretofore bound them. Open wide for them, Lord, the door to your fatherly love. May the seal of your
wisdom so penetrate them, as to cast out all tainted and foul inclinations, and let in the fragrance of your lofty
teachings. Thus shall they serve you gladly in your Church and grow daily more perfect. And once they have
tasted the medicinal property of salt, may they be fit to approach the grace of your baptism;[2] through Christ
our Lord.
All: Amen.
12. In conclusion the priest says:
Go in peace and may the Lord be with you.
All: Amen.
SECOND STAGE
13. The priest, vested in surplice and purple stole or even a cope of the same color, comes to the altar steps
with his assistants. He kneels and implores God's help, after which he rises, signs himself with the cross, and
says:
P: God, come to my rescue.
All: Lord, make haste to help me.
P: Glory be to the Father.
All: As it was in the beginning.
AT THE ENTRANCE OR IN THE VESTIBULE OF THE CHURCH
14. The priest blesses salt with this exorcism:
Exorcism
God's creature, salt, I cast out the demon from you, in the name of God the Father almighty, in the love of
our Lord Jesus Christ, and in the strength of the Holy Spirit. I purify you by the living God, the true
God, the holy God, by God who created you to be a preservative for mankind, and ordered you to be
sanctified by His ministers for the benefit of the people who are about to embrace the faith. In the name of the
Blessed Trinity may you become a saving sign empowered to drive away the enemy. Therefore, we beg you,
Lord, our God, to sanctify and to bless this creature, salt, thus providing a perfect remedy for all who
54
receive it, one that will permeate their inmost being. We ask this in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is
coming to judge both the living and the dead and the world by fire.
All: Amen.
Before giving the blessed salt to the catechumens the priest adds this prayer (using the singular forms when
required):
Let us pray.
Blessed Lord and Father, almighty and everlasting God, who is, who was, who ever shall be, whose beginning
is unknown, whose end is inconceivable. We humbly implore you on behalf of these servants of yours whom
you have freed from the shackles of error; graciously heed them as they bow low before you at the cleansing
font where one is born over again by water and the Holy Spirit. May they put off the old man and put on the
new man created in your image; may they receive the pure and spotless robe and thus become worthy of
serving you, our God; through Christ our Lord.
All: Amen.
15. Taking a pinch of blessed salt he puts it in the mouth of each catechumen, saying:
N., take this salt in sign of wisdom. May it be for you likewise a token that foreshadows everlasting life.
Candidate: Amen.
P: Peace be with you.
Candidate: And also with you.
Then he adds this prayer (using the singular forms when required):
Let us pray.
God of our fathers, God, source of all truth, we humbly ask you to be well disposed to your servants, N. and
N. After this first[3] taste of salt, let their hunger for heavenly nourishment not be prolonged but soon be
satisfied. For then they will always pay homage to your holy name with fervor, joy, and trust.[4] In your
tender care, O Lord, lead them to the bath of water where one is born over again, so that taken into the family
of your faithful they can finally attain the everlasting reward which you have promised; through Christ our
Lord.
All: Amen.
15a. Wherever it is inconvenient for the priest himself to put the salt in the mouth of the catechumens, the
conference of bishops may decide that the catechumens themselves do so, taking a pinch of salt from a larger
vessel offered to them by the priest.
16. In conclusion the priest says:
P: Go in peace and may the Lord be with you.
All: Amen.
THIRD STAGE
55
17. It is left to the prudent judgment of the Ordinary whether the three following stages, i.e., the three series
of exorcisms, are to be carried out independently and separately, or whether all three are to be combined into
one action, or even whether only one of the three is to be used, omitting the other two.
18. The ceremonies of this stage are always to take place with the men in a separate group and the same for
the women; also if convenient at a different place or time.
19. The priest, vested in surplice and purple stole or even a cope of the same color, comes to the altar steps
with his assistants. He kneels and implores God's help, after which he rises, signs himself with the cross, and
says:
P: God, come to my rescue.
All: Lord, make haste to help me.
P: Glory be to the Father.
All: As it was in the beginning.

God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, O God, who appeared to Moses, your servant, on Mt. Sinai, and led the
children of Israel out of Egypt's land, appointing your good angel over them to guard them day and night; we
beg you, Lord, if it please you, to send down your holy angel from heaven to guard these servants of yours in
like manner,[5] and to lead them to the grace of your baptism; through Christ our Lord.
All: Amen.
56
The priest then pronounces the exorcism over them, changing the plural forms to the singular when required:
Exorcism
Now, foul fiend, recall the curse that decided your fate once for all. Indeed, pay homage to the living and true
God, pay homage to Jesus Christ, His Son, and to the Holy Spirit. Keep far from these servants of God, for

baptism.
The priest makes the sign of the cross over them, while the candidates sign themselves on the brow with the

God of heaven and earth, God of the angels and archangels, God of the patriarchs and prophets, God of the
apostles and martyrs, God of the confessors and virgins, God of all the devout; God whom every tongue
praises and before whom all bend the knee, in heaven, on earth, and in the depths; I call on you, Lord, to
watch over these servants of yours in like manner,[6] and to lead them in your kindness to the grace of your
baptism; through Christ our Lord.
All: Amen.

servants of yours who desire[7] the gift of baptism and the abiding grace bestowed in this supernatural birth.
Claim them as your own, you who have graciously promised: "Ask and you shall receive, seek and you shall
find, knock and it shall be opened to you." Reach out the reward to them who ask, open wide the door to them
who knock. For then will they attain the everlasting blessing of heavenly cleansing, and possess the kingdom
which in your bounty you have promised; through Christ our Lord.
All: Amen.
The priest then pronounces the exorcism over them (using the singular forms when required):
Exorcism
Hear, accursed Satan, for I adjure you in the name of the infinite God and His Son, Jesus Christ, our Savior, to
flee in trembling and groaning, for you and your envy are vanquished. May you have nothing in common with
these servants of God, whose thoughts are already of heaven, and who are determined to renounce both you
and your world and to overcome you and so win a blessed and immortal reward. Pay homage, then, to the
Holy Spirit, who now approaches from heaven's high citadel to frustrate your wicked designs, and to prepare
their hearts, once they are purified in the grace-laden waters, as a sanctified dwelling for God. And so will
these servants of the Most High, delivered from guilt of past crimes, render endless thanks to the everlasting
God and laud His holy name forevermore.

doomed spirit, He who walked on the sea and reached out His hand to Peter as he was sinking. So then, foul
fiend, recall the curse that decided your fate once for all. Indeed, pay homage to the living and true God, pay

Holy Lord, almighty Father, everlasting God, source of light and truth, I appeal to your sacred and boundless
compassion on behalf of these servants of yours. Be pleased to enlighten them by the light of your eternal
wisdom. Cleanse, sanctify, and endow them with true knowledge.[9] For thus will they be made ready for the
grace of your baptism and ever remain steadfast, never losing hope, never faltering in duty, never straying

All: Amen.

The sponsors trace the sign of the cross on the candidates' brow with the thumb, whereas the priest makes the
sign over them--both priest and sponsors saying the words:
In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
38. Then the priest holds his hand outstretched over them and says the following (using the singular forms
when required):
Exorcism
I cast you out, unclean spirit, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Depart
and stay far away from these servants of God. For it is the Lord Himself who commands you, accursed and
doomed spirit, He who restored sight to the man born blind and raised Lazarus from the tomb where he had
lain four days. So then, foul fiend, recall the curse that decided your fate once for all. Indeed, pay homage to
the living and true God, pay homage to Jesus Christ, His Son, and to the Holy Spirit. Keep far from these
servants of God, for Jesus Christ, our Lord and God, has freely called them to His holy grace and blessed way
and to the waters of baptism. The priest makes the sign of the cross over them, while the candidates sign
themselves on the brow with the thumb; the priest says:
Never dare, accursed fiend, to desecrate this seal of the holy cross which we imprint on their brow; through
Christ our Lord, who is coming to judge both the living and the dead and the world by fire.
All: Amen.
39. Then the priest, still holding his hand outstretched over the candidates says (using the singular forms
when required):
Let us pray.
Holy Lord, almighty Father, everlasting God, source of light and truth, I appeal to your sacred and boundless
compassion on behalf of these servants of yours. Be pleased to enlighten them by the light of your eternal
wisdom. Cleanse, sanctify, and endow them with true knowledge.[10] For thus will they be made ready for
the grace of your baptism and ever remain steadfast, never losing hope, never faltering in duty, never straying
from sacred truth, but ready at all times to receive your grace; through Christ our Lord.
All: Amen.
62
The ceremony concludes with the words given in no. 40 below.
40. Lastly the priest says:
P: Go in peace and may the Lord be with you.
All: Amen.
SIXTH STAGE
AT THE ENTRANCE OR IN THE VESTIBULE OF THE CHURCH
41. At the appointed time the catechumens assemble at the church door, or at another place outside the
edifice, from where they will march in solemn procession to the church. The priest, vested in surplice and
purple stole or even a cope of the same color, comes to the altar steps with his assistants where he kneels and
implores God's help. Then he rises and goes to the church entrance where he stands facing the elect and
makes the sign of the cross, saying:
P: God, come to my rescue.
All: Lord, make haste to help me.
P: Glory be to the Father.
All: As it was in the beginning.
42. Next the priest with his left hand takes hold of the right forearm of the first elect, or else puts in his hand
the end of the stole hanging from his left shoulder, and conducts him into the church. The first candidate with
left hand holds onto the right hand of the second, the second of the third, etc.
In doing so the priest says:
Come into God's holy sanctuary to receive a heavenly blessing from our Lord Jesus Christ and to be united
with Him and His saints.
All: Amen.
43. Having come into the church the elect lie prostrate on the floor-- all at the same time--and spend a few
moments in adoration.
44. Then at a signal they rise together; the priest then holds his hand outstretched over their heads as they join
with him in reciting the Apostles' Creed and the Lord's Prayer:
AT THE GATES OF THE BAPTISTERY
All: I believe in God, the Father almighty, Creator of heaven and earth. And in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our
Lord; who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was
crucified, died, and was buried. He descended into hell; the third day He arose again from the dead. He
ascended into heaven, and sits at the right hand of God, the Father almighty; from there He shall come to
judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints,
the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting. Amen.
63
Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name; thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in
heaven. Give us this day our daily bread; and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass
against us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.
45. Standing with his back turned to the gates of the baptistery, the priest again holds his hand outstretched
over the heads of the elect, and says (using the singular forms when required):
Exorcism
Surely it is no secret to you, Satan, that punishment is your lot, torments your portion, that the day of
judgment threatens you, that day of never ending torture, the day that shall be like a flaming furnace, in the
midst of which everlasting perdition awaits you and your apostate angels. Therefore, accursed one, deservedly
doomed, pay homage to the living and true God, pay homage to Jesus Christ, His Son, and to the Holy Spirit,
the Advocate. In His name and power I command you, unclean spirit whoever you are, begone and stay far
away from these servants of God. For today Jesus Christ, our Lord and God, freely calls them to His holy
grace and blessed way and to the waters of baptism, where they will become God's dwelling by the water of
rebirth that gives full remission of sin We ask this in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is coming to
judge both the living and the dead and the world by fire.
All: Amen.
46. The priest then moistens his thumb with his spittle and touches the ears and nostrils of the person (each
one). The use of saliva may be omitted for reasons of hygiene, when there is fear of contracting or
communicating disease. But the ceremony itself is not omitted. He touches first the right ear then the left,
saying:
Ephpheta, which means: Be opened.
Next touching the nostrils he adds:
And perceive the fragrance of God's loving ways. But you, evil spirit, begone, for the judgment of God has
come.
46a. As said above, whenever there is a just cause prohibiting or dissuading the priest from using his spittle,
he may simply go through the gesture of touching the ears and nostrils.
47. Next the priest calls the candidates by their full name, first the men then the women, and each one
answers: Present Afterward he puts these questions to them:
P: Do you renounce Satan? All: I do renounce him.
P: And all his works?
All: I do renounce them.
P: And all his attractions?
All: I do renounce them.
48. Then the candidates pass in single file before the priest, who dips his thumb in the holy oil of catechumens
and anoints each one in the form of a cross, first on the breast then on the back between the shoulders,
pronouncing only once these words:
I anoint you with the oil that sanctifies in Christ Jesus our Lord, that you may have everlasting life.
64
All: Amen.
P: Peace be with you.
All: And also with you.
48a. But wherever the anointing with oil of catechumens gives rise to considerable difficulties that are
insurmountable for the time being, the conference of bishops can dispense from the practice for that particular
place or people, in accord with the norms established for the use of this new rite. Nevertheless, all priests
whose task it is to instruct catechumens and the faithful should bear in mind that they must do their utmost to
remove such difficulties, so that, as Christian practices gradually are better understood, the ceremony of
anointing catechumens with the holy oil may be observed.
In the meantime a substitute ceremony should be used, namely this, that as the candidates pass in single file
before the priest he blesses each one with the sign of the cross in the ordinary way, saying:
I strengthen you with the sign of the cross in Christ Jesus our Lord, that you may have everlasting life.
Peace be with you.
And then he goes on with the exorcism as given above.
Or the ceremony may also be performed in one action for the whole group.
49. Afterward he wipes his thumb and the spots anointed with cotton or similar material. He then adds the
following:
Go out, unclean spirit, and pay homage to the living and true God. Depart, unclean spirit, and give place to
Jesus Christ, His Son. Stay far away, unclean spirit, and give place to the Holy Spirit, the Advocate.
If the number of catechumens is large there is no objection to having these ceremonies performed by several
priests.
50. In conclusion the priest says:
P: Go in peace, and may the Lord be with you.
All: Amen.
SEVENTH STAGE
51. The elect are assembled at the baptismal font. The priest, vested in surplice and purple stole or even a
cope of the same color, comes to the altar steps with his assistants. He kneels and implores God's help. after
which he rises, signs himself with the cross, and says:
P: God, come to my rescue.
All: Lord, make haste to help me.
P: Glory be to the Father.
All: As it was in the beginning.
52. Next the priest calls the elect by their full name, and each one answers: Present. Afterward he puts these
questions to them:
65
P: Do you believe in God the Father almighty, Creator of heaven and earth?
All: I do believe.
P: Do you believe in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord, who was born into this world and suffered for us?
All: I do believe.
P: And do you believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness
of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting?
All: I do believe.
P: Do you wish to be baptized?[11]
All: I do.
53. The candidate at this moment is bareheaded and has his clothing loosened at the neck. As the godfather or
godmother (or both if two sponsors are used) take hold of or touch the candidate, the latter bends down over
the font, and the priest takes baptismal water with a ladle, pours it thrice in the form of a cross on the head of
the candidate, and baptizes him in the name of the Blessed Trinity, saying:
N., I baptize you in the name of the Father, (here he pours the first time) and of the Son, (pouring a
second time) and of the Holy Spirit (pouring a third time).
54. If the water which runs off the head of the baptized cannot fall into the sacrarium of the baptistery, it
should be caught in a basin provided for that purpose and later thrown into the sacrarium.
If several are being baptized each one has the ceremony administered to him in the manner described above;
and if there are both men and women the men are baptized first, followed by the women.
If there is doubt whether the person has already been baptized, the following form is used:
N., if you are not baptized, I baptize you, etc.
55. The priest dips his thumb in holy chrism (if convenient he may be assisted here by another priest or
several others, also vested in surplice and white stole), and in the form of a cross anoints the person on the
crown of the head, saying:
The almighty God, Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, has caused you to be born over again of water and the
Holy Spirit and pardoned you all your sins. May he now anoint you with the chrism that sanctifies in Christ
Jesus our Lord, and bring you to everlasting life.
All: Amen.
P: Peace be with you.
All: And also with you.
55a. If anointing with chrism involves a great difficulty, the conference of bishops may dispense with it (see
what is said above in no. 48a); and in this case the following alternate ceremony should be substituted:
The priest blesses each of the baptized (or all in one action) with the sign of the cross, saying:
66
The almighty God, Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, has caused you to be born over again of water and the
Holy Spirit and pardoned you all your sins. May He now fill you with His blessing in Christ Jesus our
Lord, and bring you to everlasting life.
All: Amen.
P: Peace be with you.
All: And also with you.
56. When all have been anointed with holy chrism (or blessed as directed in no. 55a), the priest wipes his
thumb with cotton or something similar. Now the sponsors give the white robe to their respective godchild as
the priest says:
Take this white robe and keep it spotless until you arrive at the judgment seat of our Lord Jesus Christ, that
you may be rewarded with everlasting life.
All: Amen.
And the baptized are now vested in the new white robes, removing if necessary some of their outer clothing.
57. Next the godparents place a lighted taper or candle in the right hand of their respective godchild as the
priest says:
Take this burning candle as a reminder to keep your baptismal innocence. Obey God's commandments, so that
when our Lord comes for the joyous wedding feast you may go forth to meet Him with all the saints in the
halls of heaven, and be happy with Him forevermore.
All: Amen.
The baptized hold the lighted candle till the end, except while being confirmed.
58. In conclusion the priest says: Go in peace, and may the Lord be with you.
All: Amen.
