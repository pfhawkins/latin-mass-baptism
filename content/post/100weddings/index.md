Recently, [@1962bride](https://www.instagram.com/1962bride/) celebrated 1 year of being on Instagram and sharing stories from Latin Mass wedding couples. The account also recently passed the 100 couple mark. 

The couples are from all over the world, marrying in diocesan and order churches, and in low Masses and Solemn Highs. In addition to the diversity of the stories, at least some of the couples noted that they were the first couple to have a Latin Mass wedding since the Second Vatican Council. 

So, I made a map to show both the geographic spread and the exponential increase of Latin Mass weddings in the past two decades. 

The map lives at [Google My Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1UgK2XQ0EawAmPjQHsH0yGLezUUrHvuEM&usp=sharing). The data is from @1962bride, and cleaned in a spreadsheet.
