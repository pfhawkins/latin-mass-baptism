# About

This page contains resources for Catholics facing the loss of a child. The page will cover some options after the loss, the rite of burial for children, and the votive Mass of the Holy Angels. 

# During the loss

> In danger of death non-solemn baptism can be administered by anyone as long as he uses the proper form and matter and has the right intention. If possible two witnesses or at least one should be present so that the baptism can be proved...It should be a pastor's concern that the faithful, particularly midwives, doctors, and surgeons be thoroughly instructed in the correct manner of baptizing in a case of necessity.[^1]

# After the loss

The Archdiocese of Dubuque offers thorough explanations on support during infant loss, especially on the care of fetal remains.[^2] 

Websites like Allay Resources collate resources from around the world on support and information for families. They have extensive resources listed for pregnancy and child loss.[^3] 

## At the hospital

If you are in a medical facility, consider connecting with the patient advocate to discuss your options. Parental rights to and options with the remains of their child can vary by state. Minnesota law, for example, says: 

> Hospitals, clinics, and medical facilities must have in place by January 15, 2009, policy for informing a woman of available options for fetal disposition when the woman experiences a miscarriage or is expected to experience a miscarriage.[^4]

# Rite of Burial for Children

> The rite given here for the burial of a child is not to be regarded as a prayer of petition of the Church for the soul of the child. Rather, it is to be seen as a prayer of praise and thanksgiving to God for having taken the child to the glory and happiness of everlasting life.[^1]

> Baptised children under the ‘age of reason’ (seven years) are assumed not to have committed actual (personal) sin; it is therefore not necessary to pray for their release from Purgatory. The Requiem Mass is not said for them; instead, either the Mass of the day, or a votive Mass (usually, the Mass of the Angels), is said for a suitable intention, such as to beg consolation for the family. There are different psalms, prayers, and ceremonies for the reception of the body, the blessing of the coffin at the end of Mass, and the burial, and the celebrant wears a white stole for these parts of the service.[^5]

Further commentary and description of the rite are available at New Liturgical Movement.[^6]

# Votive Mass of the Holy Angels 

Although there is no official designation – i.e. in the Missale Romanum or other ecclesiastical book – it has been a common practice to say the votive Mass of the Holy Angels for the loss of a child.
