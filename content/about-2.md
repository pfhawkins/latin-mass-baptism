My husband and I were married with a Latin Mass wedding in September 2018. While we were both familiar with the Latin Mass, we found that we had a good deal to learn about a Latin Mass wedding. Much knowledge has been lost about nuptial services, liturgies, customs, and expectations.

As a librarian who is chronically unable to be relaxed about anything, much of my wedding planning involved accruing piles of research on Catholic wedding masses. This website is everything I found about Latin Mass weddings, plus a lot of extra (but related) content on traditional aspects of Catholicism.

The critical stuff is in the [Rite of Marriage](https://www.latinmasswedding.com/rite-of-marriage/) and the [Wedding Mass](https://www.latinmasswedding.com/the-wedding-mass/). 

More information, from [rubrics ](https://www.latinmasswedding.com/resources/rubrics-for-the-wedding-mass/)to [roses](https://www.latinmasswedding.com/resources/flowers/), can be found under [Resources](https://www.latinmasswedding.com/resources/). 

Most pages have an "About" section at the top, to provide context.

Any word in _italics_ can be found in the [Glossary](https://www.latinmasswedding.com/resources/glossary/).

I have an [FAQ ](https://www.latinmasswedding.com/resources/faqs/)page to get you started.

If you see anything in error, or any accidental heresy, please let me know.
