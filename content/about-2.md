My husband, William, and I were married in a Latin Mass wedding on September 22, 2018. While we were both familiar with the Latin Mass, we found that we had a good deal to learn about a Latin Mass wedding. Much knowledge has been lost about nuptial services, liturgies, customs, and expectations.

As a librarian who is chronically unable to be relaxed about anything, much of my wedding planning involved accruing piles of research on Catholic wedding masses. This website is everything I found about Latin Mass weddings, plus a lot of extra (but related) content on traditional aspects of Catholicism.

The critical stuff is in the [Rite of Marriage](https://www.latinmasswedding.com/rite-of-marriage/) and the [Wedding Mass](https://www.latinmasswedding.com/the-wedding-mass/).

More information, from [rubrics ](https://www.latinmasswedding.com/resources/rubrics-for-the-wedding-mass/)to [roses](https://www.latinmasswedding.com/resources/flowers/), can be found under [Resources](https://www.latinmasswedding.com/resources/).

Most pages have an "About" section at the top, to provide context.

Any word in _italics_ can be found in the [Glossary](https://www.latinmasswedding.com/resources/glossary/).

I have an [FAQ ](https://www.latinmasswedding.com/resources/faqs/)page to get you started.

If you would like help with certain elements of Latin Mass wedding planning (that a lay person can provide), such as making a program, performing research, please [contact me](https://www.latinmasswedding.com/#contact) for a quote. 

Lastly, I have a [personal site](http://awildsostenuto.wordpress.com) full of fun and exciting research and Catholic content.
