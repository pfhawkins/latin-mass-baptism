# About

The Rite of Marriage is, "The form for the celebration of the Sacrament of Matrimony, as it stands in the "Rituale Romanum"". [^1]

This is the essential part of getting married in the Catholic Church - a Mass is not required.

**The Rite of Marriage takes places before the Mass, and has two parts: 1) exchange of vows, and 2) blessing and exchange of rings.** Usually, the homily takes place at the very beginning, even before the exchange of vows.

There are a couple of important historical notes to make about the Catholic Rite of Marriage before I include the text and rubrics of the rite.

The _Rituale Romanum_ says, "Wherever other praiseworthy customs and ceremonies are used in the celebration of the sacrament of matrimony, it is fitting that they be retained." [^2] For as much as Catholicism prizes universal teachings and practices, she also prizes reverent local customs and traditions. Because of this, and because the marriage texts were not codified until fairly late, there is some variation when it comes to the specific words in the Rite of Marriage. [^3] Given that the Rite of Marriage was likely celebrated at least partly in the vernacular, and that until Trent, public wedding Masses were extremely uncommon, variation is even less surprising [^4](Ibid.).

To quote a wiser source than me:

> Matrimony has always been celebrated with greater leeway for adaptation than other Sacraments, largely on account of its pre-Christian history as a purely domestic and civil affair. For certain, Trent decreed that marriage is a Sacrament and that it must be celebrated in church, in the presence of a priest. But Trent also left room for local adaptation (“earnestly” so). The marriage formula contained in the _Missale Romanum_ of 1570 is so bare that the austerity, itself, almost implies that it was meant to be the bare minimum to which local customs would be added. Notably, the _Rituale Romanum_ was not published until 1614, nearly half a century after the _Missale Romanum_ of the same council had been promulgated. During those intervening years, all that was provided was a Mass formulary in the 1570 missal. Even after the publication of the _Rituale_, “one must doubt that it was ever intended to be used as it stood.” Evidence shows, in fact, that local customs continued to be used in the period before the _Rituale_ was published and even afterward, up until the late nineteenth century. [^5]

(Note for those confused about the Latin book titles, as I was: the _Rituale_ has the texts for celebrating rituals, sacraments, and other ceremonies; the _Missale_ has the texts for celebrating the Mass.)

In the excerpt of the _Rituale_ below, note that the marriage vows do not include the word, "obey." This is not necessarily some subversive statement; it simply demonstrates that there can be a great deal of variety when implementing these texts and rubrics.

Now that we have some context -

I include the text for the Rite of Marriage, as found in the 1962 _Rituale Romanum._ This is to give you a starting point, an idea of what to expect. You can peruse plenty of _Rituales_ online from earlier years and find slight variations in the text (like a _Rituale_ from 1873 with English, Gallic, and German vows) \[6\]. What usually remains the same are that the Rite of Marriage took place before the Mass, and the 3 parts of the Rite: 1) homily, 2) exchange of vows, and 3) blessing and exchange of rings.

# The Text of the Rite of Marriage

## Part 1: The Exchange of Vows

The priest is vested in a surplice and white stole. If, however, the marriage ceremony is performed by the priest who is going to say the Nuptial Mass and this Mass follows immediately, the priest puts on all the vestments except the maniple, which should be placed on the altar, whence he takes it and puts it on after the marriage ceremony. To assist the priest there should be at least one acolyte, who wears a surplice and carries the book and a vessel with Holy Water. The priest interrogates the man and woman concerning their consent to marry.

First the priest asks the groom:

N., do you take N. here present, for your lawful wife according to the rite of our holy mother, the Church?

The bridegroom responds: I do.

2\. Then he asks the bride:

N., do you take N., here present, for your lawful husband according to the rite of our holy mother, the Church?

She replies: I do. \[...\]

After he has received the consent of the parties, the priest tells them to join their right hands. and says:

Ego conjúngo vos in matrimónium. In nómine Patris, et Fílii, et Spíritus Sancti. Amen. Vel aliis utatur verbis juxta receptum uniuscujusque loci ritum.

Then he sprinkles them with holy water.

## Part 2: Blessing and Exchange of Rings

Next the priest blesses the ring saying...

Bless O Lord, this ring, which we are blessing in Thy name, so that she who wears it, keeping faith with her husband in unbroken loyalty, may ever remain at peace with Thee, obedient to Thy will, and may live with him always in mutual love. Through Christ our Lord. R. Amen.

The priest then sprinkles the ring with holy water. The husband, taking the ring from the priest's hand, places it upon the ring finger of his wife's left hand, saying:

Take and wear this ring as a sign of our marriage vows. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, X and of the Holy Ghost. Amen. \[...\]

After this, if the nuptial blessing is to be given, the Mass pro Sponso et Sponsa is celebrated, according to the rubrics of the Roman Missal.
