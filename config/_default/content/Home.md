Welcome to LatinMassWedding.com!

Any Catholic wedding with a Mass has two parts: 1) the Rite of Marriage, and 2) the wedding Mass. 

This website is for those who would like a Latin Mass wedding, or are interested in learning about a beautiful and (until recently) mostly forgotten treasure of the Church. 

The Second Vatican Council reformed both the Rite and the Mass, leading to what most of us are likely familiar with when we think of a Catholic wedding Mass: a Mass, with the Rite of Marriage happening in the middle of Mass, after the homily. 

A Latin Mass wedding, on the other hand, has the Rite of Marriage before the Mass begins.

Learning about the Latin Mass can be difficult as it is; for those who are curious about a Latin Mass wedding, it can be downright overwhelming.
