Welcome to LatinMassWedding.com! 

My husband and I were married with a latin mass wedding in September 2018. While we were both familiar with the latin mass, we found that we had a good deal to learn about a latin mass wedding. Much knowledge has been lost about nuptial services, liturgies, customs, and expectations. 

This website is for those who would like a latin mass wedding, or are interested in learning about a beautiful and (until recently) mostly forgotten treasure of the Church.
