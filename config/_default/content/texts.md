This page includes the texts for the Latin Mass wedding. I will include the texts on this page, as well as links to websites that have the texts formatted in other ways.

Biretta Books offers a Latin-English booklet for Latin Mass weddings: [https://www.birettabooks.com/for-the-faithful/latin-english-booklet-missal-for-nuptial-mass/](https://www.birettabooks.com/for-the-faithful/latin-english-booklet-missal-for-nuptial-mass/ "https://www.birettabooks.com/for-the-faithful/latin-english-booklet-missal-for-nuptial-mass/")

The Latin Mass wedding mass (one of many _votive Masses_) is called _Missa pro sponso et sponsa_, or the Mass for the groom and bride. It’s in two parts: 1) the Rite of Marriage, and 2) the Mass itself.

# The Rite of Marriage

Note: Some of the marriage texts were not codified until the Council of Trent. Because of that, and of the Church's historical support for local customs, there may be a good deal of variation with the particular wording for the Rite of Marriage. The text for the Rite of Marriage below is directly from the _Rituale Romanum_. The _Rituale_ specifically says, "Wherever other praiseworthy customs and ceremonies are used in the celebration of the sacrament of matrimony, it is fitting that they be retained." In the excerpt of the _Rituale_ below, note that the marriage vows do not include the word, "obey." This is not necessarily some subversive statement; it simply demonstrates that there can be a great deal of variety when implementing these texts and rubrics.

## Part 1: The Homily

After the priest(s) and the bride process in to the church, all are seated as the priest gives his homily.

## Part 2: The Exchange of Vows

The priest is vested in a surplice and white stole. If, however, the marriage ceremony is performed by the priest who is going to say the Nuptial Mass and this Mass follows immediately, the priest puts on all the vestments except the maniple, which should be placed on the altar, whence he takes it and puts it on after the marriage ceremony. To assist the priest there should be at least one acolyte, who wears a surplice and carries the book and a vessel with Holy Water. The priest interrogates the man and woman concerning their consent to marry.

First the priest asks the groom:

N., do you take N. here present, for your lawful wife according to the rite of our holy mother, the Church?

The bridegroom responds: I do.

2\. Then he asks the bride:

N., do you take N., here present, for your lawful husband according to the rite of our holy mother, the Church?

She replies: I do. \[...\]

After he has received the consent of the parties, the priest tells them to join their right hands. and says:

Ego conjúngo vos in matrimónium. In nómine Patris, et Fílii, et Spíritus Sancti. Amen. Vel aliis utatur verbis juxta receptum uniuscujusque loci ritum.

Then he sprinkles them with holy water.

## Part 3: Blessing and Exchange of Rings

Next the priest blesses the ring saying...

Bless X O Lord, this ring, which we are blessing X in Thy name, so that she who wears it, keeping faith with her husband in unbroken loyalty, may ever remain at peace with Thee, obedient to Thy will, and may live with him always in mutual love. Through Christ our Lord. R. Amen.

The priest then sprinkles the ring with holy water. The husband, taking the ring from the priest's hand, places it upon the ring finger of his wife's left hand, saying:

Take and wear this ring as a sign of our marriage vows. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, X and of the Holy Ghost. Amen. \[...\]

After this, if the nuptial blessing is to be given, the Mass pro Sponso et Sponsa is celebrated, according to the rubrics of the Roman Missal.

# The Wedding Mass: _Missa pro sponso et sponsa_

## Introit

Tobias 7:15; 8:19

Deus Israel coniungat vos: et ipse sit vobiscum, qui misertus est duobus unicis: et nunc, Domine, fac eos plenius benedicere te.

May the God of Israel join you together: and may He be with you, who was merciful to two only children: and now, O Lord, make them bless Thee more fully.

## Epistle

Ephesians 5:22-33

Wives, be subject to your husbands, as to the Lord.  For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, and is himself its Savior. As the church is subject to Christ, so let wives also be subject in everything to their husbands. Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her, that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word,  that he might present the church to himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be holy and without blemish.  Even so husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. For no man ever hates his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, as Christ does the church, because we are members of his body. “For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.” This mystery is a profound one, and I am saying that it refers to Christ and the church; however, let each one of you love his wife as himself, and let the wife see that she respects her husband.

## Gradual

Psalms 127:3

Uxor tua sicut vitis abundans in lateribus domus tuae. V. Filii tui sicut novellae olivarum in circuitu mensae tuae. Alleluia, alleluia.

Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine on the sides of thy house. V. Thy children as olive plants round about thy table. Alleluia, alleluia.

## Alleluia

Psalms 19:3; 133:3

Alleluia, alleluia. V. Mittat vobis Dominus auxilium de sancto: et de Sion tueatur vos. Alleluia. V. Benedicat vobis Dominus ex Sion: qui fecit coelum et terram. Alleluia.

Alleluia, alleluia. V. (Ps. 19. 3) May the Lord send you help from the sanctuary, and defend you out of Sion. Alleluia. V. (Ps. 133. 3). May the Lord out of Sion bless you: who hath made heaven and earth. Alleluia.

## Gospel

Matthew 19:3-6

At that time: The Pharisees came to Jesus, tempting Him and saying; It is lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause? Who answering said to them, Have ye not read, that He who made man from the beginning, made them male and female? and He said, For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and they two shall be in one flesh. Therefore, now they are not two but one flesh. What, therefore, God hath joined together, let no man put asunder.

There should be no Gloria or Credo for the TLM wedding. The homily also happens at the very beginning, during the Rite of Marriage.

## Offertory

Psalms 30:15-16

In te speravi, Domine: dixi: Tu es Deus meus: in manibus tuis tempora mea.

In Thee, O Lord, have I hoped: I said, Thou art my God; my times are in Thy hands.

## Communion

Psalms 127:4, 6

Ecce sic benedicetur omnis homo, qui timet Dominum: et videas filios filiorum tuorum: pax super Israel.

Behold, thus shall every man be blessed that feareth the Lord; and mayest thou see thy children's children; peace upon Israel.

## Nuptial Blessing

Mercifully give ear, O Lord, to our prayers, and let thy grace accompany this thy institution, by which thou hast ordained the propagation of mankind, that this tie, which is made by thy authority, may be preserved by thy grace. Through Our Lord...

R. Amen.

Let us pray.

O God, who, by the power of thy might, didst create all things out of nothing: who, at the first forming of the world, having made man to the likeness of God, didst, out of his flesh, make the woman, and give her to him for a help-mate: and by this didst inform us, that what in its beginning was one, ought never to be separated. O God, who by so excellent a mystery, hast consecrated this union of the two sexes, and hast been pleased to make it a type of the great sacrament of Christ and his Church, O God, by whom woman is joined to man, and that union, which was instituted in the beginning, is still accompanied with such a blessing, as alone, neither in punishment of original sin, nor by the sentence of the deluge, had been recalled; mercifully look down upon this thy handmaid, who, being now to be joined in wedlock, earnestly desires to be taken under thy protection: may love and peace constantly remain in her: may she marry in Christ faithful and chaste: may she ever imitate the holy women of former times: may she be pleasing to her husband, like Rachael: discreet, like Rebecca; may she, in her years and fidelity, be like Sarah: and may the first author of all evil, at no time, have any share in her actions. May she remain attached to the faith and the commandments, and, being joined to one man in wedlock, may she fly all unlawful addresses: may a regularity of life and conduct be her strength against the weakness of her sex: may she be modest and grave, bashful and venerable, and well instructed in heavenly doctrine. May she be fruitful in her offspring, approved and innocent; and may it be at length her happy lot to arrive at the rest of the blessed in the kingdom of God: may they both see their children's children to the third and fourth generation, and live to their wished-for old age. Through Our Lord...

R. Amen.

May the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob be with you: and may he fulfill his blessing in you; that you may see your children's children to the third and fourth generation: and afterwards enter into the possession of eternal life, through the assistance of our Lord Jesus Christ, who with the Father and the Holy Ghost, liveth, &c.

R. Amen.
