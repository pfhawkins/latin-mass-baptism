The TLM wedding mass (one of many _votive Masses_) is called _Missa pro sponso et sponsa_, or the Mass for the groom and bride. Itâ€™s in two parts: 1) the Rite of Marriage, and 2) the Mass itself.

There should be no Gloria or Credo for the TLM wedding. The homily also happens at the very beginning, during the Rite of Marriage.
