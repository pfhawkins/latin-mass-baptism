The Latin Mass wedding mass (one of many _votive Masses_) is called _Missa pro sponso et sponsa_, or the Mass for the groom and bride. It’s in two parts: 1) the Rite of Marriage, and 2) the Mass itself.

# The Rite of Marriage

Note: Some of the marriage texts were not codified until the Council of Trent. Because of that, and of the Church's historical support for local customs, there may be a good deal of variation with the particular wording for the Rite of Marriage. The text for the Rite of Marriage below is directly from the _Rituale Romanum_, a \[definition\]. 

## Part 1: The Homily

After the priest(s) and the bride process in to the church, all are seated as the priest gives his homily.

## Part 2: The Exchange of Vows

The priest is vested in a surplice and white stole. If, however, the marriage ceremony is performed by the priest who is going to say the Nuptial Mass and this Mass follows immediately, the priest puts on all the vestments except the maniple, which should be placed on the altar, whence he takes it and puts it on after the marriage ceremony. To assist the priest there should be at least one acolyte, who wears a surplice and carries the book and a vessel with Holy Water. The priest interrogates the man and woman concerning their consent to marry.

First the priest asks the groom:

N., do you take N. here present, for your lawful wife according to the rite of our holy mother, the Church?

The bridegroom responds: I do.

2\. Then he asks the bride:

N., do you take N., here present, for your lawful husband according to the rite of our holy mother, the Church?

She replies: I do. \[...\]

After he has received the consent of the parties, the priest tells them to join their right hands. and says:

Ego conjúngo vos in matrimónium. In nómine Patris, et Fílii, et Spíritus Sancti. Amen. Vel aliis utatur verbis juxta receptum uniuscujusque loci ritum.

Then he sprinkles them with holy water.

## Part 3: Blessing and Exchange of Rings

Next the priest blesses the ring saying...

Bless X O Lord, this ring, which we are blessing X in Thy name, so that she who wears it, keeping faith with her husband in unbroken loyalty, may ever remain at peace with Thee, obedient to Thy will, and may live with him always in mutual love. Through Christ our Lord. R. Amen.

The priest then sprinkles the ring with holy water. The husband, taking the ring from the priest's hand, places it upon the ring finger of his wife's left hand, saying:

Take and wear this ring as a sign of our marriage vows. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, X and of the Holy Ghost. Amen. \[...\]

After this, if the nuptial blessing is to be given, the Mass pro Sponso et Sponsa is celebrated, according to the rubrics of the Roman Missal.

There should be no Gloria or Credo for the TLM wedding. The homily also happens at the very beginning, during the Rite of Marriage.
