Married saints are already a tiny fraction of the Church's glittering array of saints; unfortunately among those small numbers are many men and women who are venerated for not being married - that is, they joined a religious order after leaving their spouse or after the death of their spouse. 

Perhaps because of the intensely intimate nature of marriage, and of many theologians' difficult relationship with holiness, marriage, and sex, the result is that we are left with too few models of holy married men and women. I will include some below, with the disclaimer that not all are saints (yet). 

Karl and Zita Habsburg

Ludwig Windthorst 

Louis and Zelie Martin 

Edmund the Confessor (patron of trouble marriages)

Catherine of Aragon
