Married saints are already a tiny fraction of the Church's glittering array of saints; unfortunately among those small numbers are many men and women who are venerated for not being married - that is, they joined a religious order after leaving their spouse or after the death of their spouse, or they were forced into marriage, or they were martyred by their spouse.

Perhaps because of the intensely intimate nature of marriage, and of many theologians' difficult relationship with holiness, marriage, and sex, the result is that we are left with too few models of holy married men and women. I will include some below, with the disclaimer that not all are saints (yet).

Sts. Louis and Zelie Martin

St. Edmund the Confessor (patron of trouble marriages)

St. Catherine of Aragon

St Monica

St. Thomas More

Bl. Karl and Servant of God Zita Habsburg

G. K. and Frances Chesterton
