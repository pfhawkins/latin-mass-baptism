Pope Pius X, _Tra le Sollecitudini_ (1903)  
Gregorian Chant has always been regarded as the supreme model for sacred music. \[....\] The language proper to the Roman Church is Latin. Hence it is forbidden to sing anything whatever in the vernacular in solemn liturgical functions – much more to sing in the vernacular the variable or common parts of the Mass and Office.
