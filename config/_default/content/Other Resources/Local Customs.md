Local wedding customs are difficult to describe. For one, by their nature they are usually passed on orally, not in writing. For another, an unfortunate consequence of the Council of Trent was a widespread loss of local customs in favor of uniformity with Rome.

What I have found on this topic is scattershot, varying in verifiability, and largely personal (i.e., I am half Lithuanian-American, so the customs I know the best are Lithuanian).

(NC)--The new tabernacle curtain at Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church runs on golden wedding rings. The curtain and the wedding-ring idea were copied after the curtain in the chapel of the Blessed Sacrament in Westminster Cathedral, London, at the suggestion of the pastor, the Rev. Henry van Boxel. Wedding rings which in some families had been handed down from generation to generation and the wedding rings of widows were -riven for this Louisiana church. . The London chapel was furnished by donations of the Spanish people.
