Local wedding customs are difficult to describe. For one, by their nature they’re usually passed on orally, not in writing. For another, an unfortunate consequence of the Council of Trent was a widespread loss of local customs in favor of uniformity with Rome.

What I have found on this topic is scattershot, varying in verifiability, and largely personal (i.e., I am half Lithuanian-American, so the customs I know the best are Lithuanian).
