> Anemones were also sacred flowers, possibly the “lilies of the field” mentioned in the New Testament. Some legends say that the red petals of these wild anemones came from the blood dripping down on them from Christ’s cross, and that they sprang up miraculously in Pisa’s Campo Santo cemetery after a Crusader ship had brought some earth for the graves back from the Holy Land.

> In February we found it gay with the beautiful crimson anemone (A. coronaria), which we were quite willing to accept as the ‘Rose of Sharon,’ while a little yellowish-white iris, of more modest appearance, growing along with it, represented the ‘lily of the valley’ of Solomon’s song.

Kandeler, Riklef, and Wolfram R. Ullrich. “Symbolism of Plants: Examples from European-Mediterranean Culture Presented with Biology and History of ArtSEPTEMBER: Cornflower.” _Journal of Experimental Botany_, vol. 60, no. 12, Aug. 2009, pp. 3297–99. _academic.oup.com_, doi:[10.1093/jxb/erp247](https://doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erp247).

> Cyanus (blue) was the name of the cornflower from Mediterranean antiquity up to the 18th century. The scientific name of the genus, Centaurea (given by Linnaeus) was derived from the story of the ‘centaur’ Chiron, Achilles’ adviser. According to Greek myth, Achilles was wounded with a poisoned arrow (by Herakles), and his wound was healed by applying cornflower plants. The poison came from Hydra, in Greek mythology usually imagined as a huge poisonous water snake, but at that time interpreted as a giant slug. In Christian symbolism, slugs were associated with the devil, hence the remedy, cornflower, became a symbol of the Queen of Heaven, Mary, and Christ, and was often depicted in paintings of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, frequently seen in Christian frescos. A fine example is found in St Michael's church in Bamberg (northern Bavaria). On the vaulted ceiling several hundred plant species have been depicted, among them cornflower (Fig. 2). \[...\] The cornflower has also been used as a symbol of tenderness, of fidelity, and of reliability (Beuchert, 2004). Botticelli (15th century) decorated the garments of some of the figures in his paintings with a cornflower design (e.g. in the ‘Birth of Venus’). Another example from Botticelli was discussed in the Plant Culture series by Battey (2003) as a decoration of ‘spring’ personified. By contrast, cornflower has also been used as a symbol of power and majesty such as in the tapestry called ‘Verdure of arms of Emperor Charles V’ (Fig. 3). The two-headed eagle as the sign of the Habsburg Monarchy and the coat of arms is surrounded by various realistically-drawn plants, among them cornflower, with its tubular florets and characteristic bracts dominating the space.

> Still, such tree souvenirs were dwarfed by the colossal number of flower bouquets, and cornflowers in particular, sent to Wilhelm I at each milestone in his life. Supplanting the oak tree as royal emblem, the cornflower was so ubiquitous...that it became known as “the Emperor’s flower” (_Kaiserblume_) and remained so well after his death.
