First and foremost: Contact your parish and your diocese to determine the required marriage preparation procedures (sometimes called Pre-Cana). Typically, Catholic dioceses and parishes require some or all of the following:

* 6 months' notice before your wedding
* meeting(s) with the pastor of your parish
* a workshop/retreat with your diocese
* FOCCUS Survey
* a workshop on Natural Family Planning

Below are supplemental materials about Catholic marriage, and the domestic life. They range from academic tomes to early 20th century pamphlets to recent social media campaigns.
