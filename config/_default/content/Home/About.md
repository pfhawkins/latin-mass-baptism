My husband and I were married in a Latin Mass wedding in September 2018. While we were both familiar with the Latin Mass, we found that we had a good deal to learn about a Latin Mass **wedding**. Much knowledge has been lost about nuptial rites, liturgies, customs, blessings, and expectations.

I'm a librarian, and am chronically unable to be relaxed about anything, so I accrued a fair amount of research material on Catholic wedding masses. So, this website is everything I found about Latin Mass weddings, plus a lot of extra stuff.

For those planning a Latin Mass wedding, the critical stuff is in 1) The Rite of Marriage and 2) The Wedding Mass.

I also have pages about flowers, programs, local customs, music, married saints, and more.

Any word in _italics_ can be found in the Glossary.  
I have an FAQ page to get you started.
