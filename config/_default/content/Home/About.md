My husband and I were married in a Latin Mass wedding in September 2018. While we were both familiar with the Latin Mass, we found that we had a good deal to learn about a Latin Mass **wedding**. Much knowledge has been lost about nuptial rites, liturgies, customs, blessings, and expectations.

I'm a librarian, and am chronically unable to be relaxed about anything, so I accrued what is likely an above average amount of research material on Catholic wedding masses. If social media is anything to go by, Latin Masses are on the rise (the pre55 Holy Week movement is a great example) and that includes Latin Mass weddings \[1\]. So, this website is everything I found about Latin Mass weddings, plus a lot of extra stuff.

For those planning a Latin Mass wedding, the critical stuff is in 1) The Rite of Marriage and 2) The Wedding Mass.

I also have pages about flowers, programs, local customs, music, married saints, and more.

Any word in _italics_ can be found in the Glossary. I have an FAQ page to get you started.
