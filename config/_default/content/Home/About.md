My husband and I were married with a latin mass wedding in September 2018. While we were both familiar with the latin mass, we found that we had a good deal to learn about a latin mass wedding. Much knowledge has been lost about nuptial services, liturgies, customs, and expectations.

I'm a librarian and am unable to be relaxed about anything, so I accrued an above average amount of research and materials on Catholic wedding masses. If social media is anything to go by, Latin Masses are on the rise (the pre55 Holy Week movement is a great example) and that includes Latin Mass weddings. So, this website is everything I found about Latin Mass weddings, plus a lot of extra stuff.

The critical stuff is in 1) The Rite of Marriage and 2) The Wedding Mass.

Any word in _italics_ can be found in the Glossary. I have an FAQ page to get you started.
