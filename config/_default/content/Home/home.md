Welcome to LatinMassWedding.com!

A Catholic wedding Mass has two parts: 1) the Rite of Marriage, and 2) the wedding Mass.

In the current form of the Catholic Mass (the _Novus Ordo_), the Rite of Marriage takes place in the middle of Mass, directly after the homily. 

In the older form of the Catholic Mass (the _Latin Mass_), the Rite of Marriage takes places before the Mass even begins. Additinoally, there are substantial differences between the _Novus Ordo_ and the _Latin Mass_.

Learning about the Latin Mass can be difficult as it is; learning about Latin Mass weddings can be downright overwhelming - not because over the overwhelming amount of material, but because of a distinct scarcity of material on Latin Mass weddings.

This website provides information for those who would like a Latin Mass wedding, or are interested in learning about beautiful treasures of the Church regarding marriage.
