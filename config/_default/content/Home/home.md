Welcome to LatinMassWedding.com!

Any Catholic wedding with a Mass has two parts: 1) the Rite of Marriage, and 2) the wedding Mass.

The current form of the Catholic Mass (the _Novus Ordo_) has the Rite of Marriage taking place in the middle of Mass, directly after the homily. The older form of the Catholic Mass (the _Latin Mass_) is not only substantially different from the _Novus Ordo_ - it places the Rite of Marriage before the Mass even begins.

Learning about the Latin Mass can be difficult as it is; for those who are curious about a Latin Mass wedding, it can be downright overwhelming.

This website provides information for those who would like a Latin Mass wedding, or are interested in learning about beautiful treasures of the Church.
