> In December 1563, the Council of Trent, already in process for nearly twenty years, decided that it could not itself undertake the task of reforming the liturgical books of the Western churches in communion with Rome, so it handed the task over to the pope. Five years later, the revised Roman Breviary appeared and, in 1570, the Missal. However, the Missal only contained the texts used in the celebration of the Mass. For the revised marriage rite, Catholics had to wait until the new Ritual was published in 1614. 
>
> Thus the contracting of marriage was separated from its solemnization: the order for the former being found in the Ritual, while the Mass and nuptial blessing were contained in the Missal. The two dimensions of the rite were frequently separated in practice, since marriages contracted in the "closed seasons" and marriages in which one partner was not a Catholic of where the woman was marrying for the second time could not be "solemnized" and were celebrated without Mass or without the blessing. 
>
> Nonetheless, the Council of Trent did more for marriage than order a revision of the rites. A major preoccupation of the Council was with the social mischief created by clandestine marriages, i.e. marriages entered into simply through the couple's exchange of consent, without public ceremony. Such was the concern of the Council that it took the unprecedented step of declaring such marriages simply void and invalid, despite the long history of the axiom that "consent makes marriage." One of the consequences of this was that Catholic marriages, to be considered valid, had to be celebrated now in the presence of a priest and in accordance with ecclesiastical law. Consequently, while we can never be quite sure whether ordinary people were wedded ceremoniously with the rites we have seen so far, it is certain that from that the sixteenth century, all marriages took place in church, with or without the nuptial Mass.

> The text of the Wedding Mass is characteristic of the Tridentine Missal in that it is not at all innovative. It approximates to many local missals of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, but is relatively simple and sober. The Gregorian Mass formularies stand alone, no longer accompanied by the various non-Roman texts that had continued to cluster around them throughout the Middle Ages, though the old Spanish prayer, "May the God of Abraham," is retained for a final blessing of the couple at the end of Mass. Fortunately, instead of the Mass of the Trinity which was so common in the Middle Ages, the Roman Missal opted to reclaim the proper texts for the Mass for Bride and Groom from the twelfth century Roman Pontifical.
